# Population Graph Generator

## Description

The "Population Graph Generator" is a project centered around the creation of population evolution graphs for various countries over the years. The project relies on a Python script that extracts population data from a CSV file and generates scatter plots to visualize the comparative population trends across multiple countries.

## Operation

The project is executed through a Python script. The steps to use it are as follows:

1. **Repository Cloning:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following git command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/population_graph.git
   ```

2. **Script Execution:** Run the main script using Python 3:

   ```shell
   python3 main.py
   ```

3. **Country Selection:** The script will prompt you to input the names of countries, separated by commas or spaces (up to a maximum of 4 countries).

4. **Graph Generation:** After entering the countries, the script will generate scatter plots that display the population evolution of the selected countries over the years.

## Benefits

The key advantages of this project are as follows:

- **Comparative Visualization:** It allows for the comparison of population evolution among several countries in a single graph, making it easier to discern trends and disparities.

- **Access to Population Data:** It utilizes population data available in a CSV file, offering the opportunity to analyze and visualize demographic information from various regions across the globe.

- **Customization and Collaboration:** The project is open-source and can be customized and enhanced by the community. It also provides an opportunity for collaborative efforts to improve data visualization.
